A personal project that fetches stock market data from "alphavantage" API such as open price, high/low prices, close prices, and volume on any given day.

Tickers are fetched from JSON file(s) that are in the data-sets folder in this repository.

This is an interactive UI in which users can choose which data they would like displayed, based on whatever ticker they choose.
